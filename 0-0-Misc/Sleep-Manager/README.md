# Sleep-Manager

A useful **shortcut** to **set** Notebook's **Close-Lid Action** on *Windows*.

It was written during I was learning **Win32** and **C**. (Good Memory~ :smile:)

## When to Use

When you wanna *listen to some music* or *download some large stuff*,
the Apps *Stop Working* when your Notebook's *Lid is closed*.

Then you can use this **Shortcut**, instead of goto to the *Setting* Page.

## How to Use

- The system's Close-lid Action is set to **None** when this app is **running**.
- The system's Close-lid Action is reset to **Previous one** when it **Quits**.

## Some more Details

- There will be some **Notification** when you **Change Power Schemes** or **Close/Open Lid**.
- Don't worry about **Shutdown Computer**, the previous setting will be restored.
